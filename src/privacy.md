1. **How Do You Use My Personal Data?**

1. **How Long Will You Keep My Personal Data?**

   We will not keep your personal data for any longer than is necessary in light of the reason(s) for which it was first collected.

1. **How and Where Do You Store or Transfer My Personal Data?**

   We may store or transfer some or all of your personal data in countries that are not part of the European Economic Area (EEA). These are known as “third countries” and may not have data protection laws that are as strong as those in the UK and/or the EEA. This means that we will take additional steps in order to ensure that your personal data is treated just as safely and securely as it would be within the UK and under the GDPR. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transaction will be encrypted using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our sites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone. Where we transfer your data to a third party based in the US, this may be protected if they are part of the EU-US Privacy Shield. This requires that third party to provide data protection to standards similar levels of data protection to those in Europe. More information is available from the European Commission. Please contact us using the details below in Part 11 for further information about the particular data protection mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data to a third country. The security of your personal data is essential to us, and to protect your data we have procedures in place to manage any suspected personal data breach and will notify the regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

1. **Do You Share My Personal Data?**
   
   We may need to/or be legally required to share certain personal data under the following circumstances:
   * In the event that we sell or buy any business assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business assets. If the use or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by us about our customers will be one of the transferred assets. In the event that we sell, transfers, or merges parts of our operation or assets with a third-party organisation, then the new owners or operators may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice.
   * If we are required to exchange information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction (including debt collection agencies).
   * If we are required to exchange information to meet regulatory obligations including statutory or regulatory reporting, the detection or prevention of unlawful acts, protecting our rights, property or those of our customers/and or others and are involved in legal proceedings, a court order, or the instructions of a government authority.
   * Government departments where reporting is mandatory under applicable law
   * Contracts with third parties to supply products to you on our behalf which may include payment processing and marketing

   Your personal data may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Notice.

   We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law and our own specific and stringent security requirements. We do not allow the above third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

   If any of your personal data is required by a third party, as described above, we will take steps to ensure that your personal data is handled safely, securely, and in accordance with your rights, our obligations, and the third party’s obligations under the law, as described above in Part 8.

   If any personal data is transferred outside of the EEA, we will take suitable steps in order to ensure that your personal data is treated just as safely and securely as it would be within the UK and under the GDPR, as explained above in Part 8.

   If you would like any further information about the third parties that your personal data is shared with please contact the Data Protection Officer.

1. **How Can I Access My Personal Data?**

   If you want to know what personal data we have about you, you can ask us for details of that personal data and for a copy of it (where any such personal data is held). This is known as a “subject access request”.All subject access requests should be made in writing and sent to the email or postal addresses shown in Part 11. To make this as easy as possible for you, a Subject Access Request Form is available for you to use. You do not have to use this form, but it is the easiest way to tell us everything we need to know to respond to your request as quickly as possible. To request a copy of the form contact the Data Protection Officer. There is not normally any charge for a subject access request. If your request is ‘manifestly unfounded or excessive’ (for example, if you make repetitive requests) a fee may be charged to cover our administrative costs in responding. We will respond to your subject access request within 40 calendar days of receiving it. Normally, we aim to provide a complete response, including a copy of your personal data within that time. In some cases, however, particularly if your request is more complex, more time may be required up to a maximum of three months from the date we receive your request. You will be kept fully informed of our progress.
