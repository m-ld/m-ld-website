question: Where is my data?
---
<p>Logically, data belongs to a <i>domain</i>, which is a collection of clones that belong to it. A clone is identified by a domain name, like <code>example.m-ld.org</code>.</p>

<p>The data is physically stored in the clone, which is typically embedded in the app that uses it. Different clone implementations may:</p><ul>
  <li>Keep the data in memory only</li>
  <li>Persist the data directly to disk</li>
  <li>Use some platform-specific local storage</li>
</ul>
