question: Where is my data?

<p>The data is physically stored locally to an app in a <i>clone</i>, which is
typically embedded in the app via a library engine, or very close by in a local
process. Different clone engines may:</p><ul>
  <li>Keep the data in memory only</li>
  <li>Persist the data directly to disk</li>
  <li>Use some platform-specific local storage</li>
</ul>

<p>Logically, data belongs to a <i>domain</i>, which is a collection of clones
that belong to it. An app could use one or more domains for different
purposes.</p>
