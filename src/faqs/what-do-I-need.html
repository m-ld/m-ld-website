question: To use m-ld, what do I need?

<p><b>m-ld</b> is usually deployed embedded in your app so that access latency
is zero. So, first you need a <a><b>m-ld</b> engine</a> for your app's platform.
Alternatively, you could use a clone deployed on a server (for example, using a
<a>Docker microservice</a>).</p>

<p>You also need a <a>supported message broker</a>. If you'd like to deploy your
own, you could use <a href="https://mosquitto.org/">Eclipse Mosquitto</a>, but
it might be better to use a cloud service. Note the <a>requirements for a
message broker</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, if your app requires data to be persisted after the last user has
closed it, you will need a clone deployed on a server, which stores the data
onto disk. A <a>Docker microservice</a> is ideal for this.</p>
