<p><b>m-ld</b> keeps information <a href="/news/#live-and-sharable">live and sharable</a>.</p>

<p>With <b>m-ld</b>, information is just local state, which is shared to where
it's used&mdash;on mobiles, in browsers, in microservices, anywhere.</p>

<p>At the heart of <b>m-ld</b> is a decentralised protocol for distributing live
state among <i>clones</i>. Using <b>m-ld</b>, every app instance has read-write
access to the shared information via its local clone, with zero network latency.
Changes to the information are propagated to all other app instances, so they
are all <i>eventually consistent</i>.</p>
