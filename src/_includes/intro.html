<p><b>m-ld</b> is a revolutionary new way of thinking about your app data.</p>

<p>At its heart, <b>m-ld</b> is a decentralised protocol for distributing app state. Using <b>m-ld</b>, every app instance&mdash;on mobile, in the browser, in a microservice, anywhere&mdash;has read-write access to the shared state with zero latency. Changes to the state are propagated to all other app instances, so that they are all <i>eventually consistent</i>.</p>
