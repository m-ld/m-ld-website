As we continue our work on the features of **m-ld**, we've found that you (and
we too) often want to quickly try out the query and transaction syntax against a
temporary domain.

Now it's easy! The [playground](/playground/) is designed just for that. It's
all explained once you're there, and there's even an introductory video. We've
also added some more examples to the Javascript engine transaction
[documentation](https://js.m-ld.org/#transactions), to help you find your way
into the language.

Many thanks to everyone who has contacted us about use-cases in specialist
domains. We're always open to having a chat, so get in touch by
[email](info@m-ld.io), use the [feedback](/hello/) form, or drop us a note on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/m_ld_io) or
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/m-ld-io/).

Have a great Autumn!
