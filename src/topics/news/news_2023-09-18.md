Wow. It's been a long road.

Back in 2020 I plunged into lockdown with a [heck of an vision](/news/#live-and-sharable). I was going to change the way software is built, with a plucky new component called **m-ld**.

I had _no idea_ how immensely long it would take, just to put something out there that I'm satisfied with. It seemed that every time I took one step forward, I saw ten additional steps to take.

Now, with the help of some truly special people, I'm excited to say those steps don't reach into infinity any more.

In fact, [they fit on my screen](https://github.com/orgs/m-ld/projects/4).

We've cracked some of the big tickets [(mentioned last time)](/news/#news_2023-06-22) that we always knew would be essential for adoption, but we never seemed to get to. And suddenly, we turn the corner to find the vision still shining brightly, right in our faces.

If you've been here before, first of all thanks for coming back. If you're new, welcome. Over the next few weeks I'll be out & about a lot more than I have been, and I really look forward to meeting you or catching up with you.

In the meantime please please do [contact us](/hello/) or [book a chat on my calendar](https://bit.ly/m-ld-george-chat).

Hold onto your hats folks. Software is about to change.
