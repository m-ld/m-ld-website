In principle, a **m-ld** clone contains realtime domain data. There is no
supported way to deliberately switch off the publication and receipt of updates
(note that [access&nbsp;control](/doc/#access-control) is addressed separately).
A clone may be *offline*, temporarily or for an extended period, but this is not
logically distinct from extraordinary network latency.

Another way to look at this, is to say that the domain is ephemeral and only
exists as some hypothetical convergent state of all the clones. A clone can only
ever be "up-to-date" with respect to another clone.

This means that an app does not in principle need to behave differently based on
the currency of the domain data presented â€“ for example, once initialised, a
clone can always accept data writes.

In practice, the [clone&nbsp;API](https://spec.m-ld.org/#clone-api) does support an
indication of status, including online/offline, to allow for special behaviours
such as user notifications.
