We have reached our first engineering milestone, the developer preview. It's
right here. Thanks for visiting! On this website you'll find information about
**m-ld**, including why and how to use it. There's also a cool demo app (press
the big blue button) which shows one possible use-case for **m-ld**.

And of course, the main event is the
[Javascript&nbsp;engine](https://js.m-ld.org/), which you can download and begin
to experiment with.

We're sure that **m-ld** is going to be right for many interesting use-cases.
We're working really hard on the ergonomics, the performance and the security.
We especially know that you're not going to settle for anything less than
absolute data safety. We're not there yet, but we're ready for your feedback.

If you have a request or a question to share, go to the Issues page of our
dedicated GitHub [feedback&nbsp;repo](https://github.com/m-ld/feedback/issues).
If you're unsure where to start, or you'd just like to talk, you can
[email&nbsp;us](mailto:info@m-ld.io) any time.

I do hope everyone is thriving; and we'll stay in touch!
