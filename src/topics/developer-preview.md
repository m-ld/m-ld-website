We have reached our first engineering milestone, the developer preview. It's
right here. Thanks for visiting! On this website you'll find information about
**m-ld**, including why and how to use it. There's also a cool demo app (press
the big blue button) which shows one possible use-case for **m-ld**.

And of course, the main event is the
[Javascript&nbsp;engine](https://js.m-ld.org/), which you can download and begin
to experiment with.

We're sure that **m-ld** is going to be right for many many interesting
use-cases. We're working really hard on the ergonomics, the performance and the
security. We especially know that you're not going to settle for anything less
than absolute data safety. We're not there yet, but we're ready for your feedback.

If you're unsure where to start or you'd just like to talk, we're here! You can
join the discussion on the Issues page of our dedicated GitHub
[feedback&nbsp;repo](https://github.com/m-ld/feedback/issues), or
[email&nbsp;us](mailto:info@m-ld.io) anytime.
