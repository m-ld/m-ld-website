This week we were proud to present a posters & demos track paper about **m-ld** at [SEMANTiCS](https://2021-eu.semantics.cc/)!

We don't talk much here on the website about our internal data representation, [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/), because unless you're building an app that also works with RDF, it's easier to just treat **m-ld** data as [JSON](http://json.org/) – we're committed to making shared data as easy as possible for app developers without adding yet another technology for you to learn. But the choice of RDF will really pay off in the long run.

Why? Because the vision of RDF is not only to bring developers together by sharing a format, but also to bring data together, by sharing _meaning_ ("semantics"). With RDF the data you work on today, in your app, has already begun to be ready to be integrated with data from other apps – when (not _if_) that becomes a requirement.

This vision is more important today than ever, and the talks from our colleagues at the conference showed this with real use-cases (sometimes blowing our minds in the process): from [answering questions about the COVID-19 response](https://2021-eu.semantics.cc/knowledge-retrieving-coronabot-german-government-driven-semantic-technologies), to [applying machine-readable semantics to legal documents](https://2021-eu.semantics.cc/applying-semantics-legal-data-gfwm-special-track) (something we have [our own ideas about](https://github.com/m-ld/m-ld-security-spec/blob/main/threats/legal-docs.md)!).

Still, RDF needs thought when it comes to actually sharing information live for realtime collaboration. That's where we come in!
