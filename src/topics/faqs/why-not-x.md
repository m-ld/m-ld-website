**m-ld** is one of a number of technologies for data, with different trade-offs
and strengths. These range from decentralised realtime data stores, through
blockchain-based consensus systems, to NoSQL and relational databases.

The choice of **m-ld** might be particularly driven by:
- the need for realtime data updates for live decision making on derived data
  and knowledge;
- integration of data sharing features into existing apps;
- your deployment environment [platform](/doc/#platforms) types.
