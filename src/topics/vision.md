"Most application code just shuffles data around, from rows to objects to text to models and back again. It's all based on the idea of static sources-of-truth: those files and databases we relied on so heavily in the pre-internet age.

"I was working on a new user interface for humans to collaborate on structured ideas, but when I started building it, I realised this naive foundational concept – that information exists in just one place – is not just painful to code; it's plain wrong.

"So I took what I knew about information modeling, from two decades handling research data, and mixed it with fresh thinking from the local-first and distributed systems communities, and created a component that doesn't hide the truth: that information is shared, and live. But it also simplifies the consequences in a usable way.

"You can build collaboration apps. You can build shared consciousness for robots. But most of all you can write code that deals with information as it really is."
