Consumer concerns about personal data include increasing awareness of data
ownership. Centralised data management may always have its place where ownership
is also centralised. It should never have been the only choice for everything.

But decentralised data is hard. Keeping data on devices risks losing it.
Deciding who owns what, even if someone else is working on it, requires complex
webs of trust. Deploying data replicas can be an unbounded system adminstration
headache.

[**m-ld** frees your data](/doc/#decentralisation). It uncouples ownership from
location, and so supports apps that keep control over data while still being
able to easily and safely keep it backed-up in a choice of locations.
