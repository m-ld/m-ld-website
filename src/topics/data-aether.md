> _Let's talk about data._
> 
> Data is intrinsic to software. It's the inputs and the outputs. It flows in
> through interfaces, being checked and piped and deconstructed to fine
> granules, which find their way into and through the tiniest of subroutines.
> Some of it is discarded and deleted or garbage collected, but some will be
> transformed and routed and merged into new wholes, and delivered.
