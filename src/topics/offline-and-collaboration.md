Consumer and enterprise apps are frequently required to make data available for
editing by multiple users instantly, reliably, and securely, even when they're
offline. Cloud databases entrust the data to a third party, and make users wait
while changes are processed. Custom solutions are expensive and fraught with
hard-to-detect bugs.

Fulfilling these needs is a difficult problem, and a distraction from your focus
on the business functionality of your software. In the end, most apps just lock
the data that is being edited so no-one else can work on it.

[**m-ld** is different](/doc/#realtime). It starts from the position that the
most important thing about this kind of data is the freedom to edit it safely,
live.
