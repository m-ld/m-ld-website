**m-ld** is a protocol and a set of engines to help software engineers deliver
sharing of structured data. Using **m-ld** allows features such as online
collaboration, offline editing, and data synchronisation to be delivered in less
time, with less cost, and more reliably.

Within the scope of the **m-ld** protocol it is possible to achieve different
[trade-offs](/doc/#trade-offs), to support a range of data and knowledge sharing
[use-cases](/doc/#use-cases).

**m-ld** should not be considered for the complete management of big data
(although it can be part of a big data architecture), for sharing of binary
files, or for sharing of high-rate raw data (e.g. above 60Hz).
