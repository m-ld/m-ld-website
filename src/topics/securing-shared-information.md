We're proud to announce that [NLnet](https://nlnet.nl) have chosen to commit
grant funding to us for security research, under the NGI Assure programme!

The project, **Securing Shared Decentralised Live Information with m-ld**, will
research and prototype modifications to the primitives of the m-ld core protocol
to natively support strong assurance of data integrity and traceability, with
authority assignable to identified actors, such as users or groups.

NLnet has said: *Collaborative software does not currently keep track of
authenticity information on the edits by the actors with cryptographic strength.
Yet this is a requirement when parties without a mutually trusted platform want
to collaborate on a project. Developing a protocol and software for this
situation can bring about a big step for collaborating on the internet.*

We're really looking forward to working towards an _open information society_ in
collaboration with NLnet and its partners.

NGI Assure is made possible with financial support from the European
Commission's Next [Generation Internet programme](https://ngi.eu/).

Look out for our introductory article, coming soon; and you'll also be able to
keep track of the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/m-ld). As always, your
[feedback](/hello/) is most welcome! Do you have a use-case we can talk about?
