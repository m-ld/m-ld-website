summary: <b>m-ld</b> uses cutting-edge published computer science and established standards.
---
**m-ld** stands on the shoulders of giants. It utilises a combination of:
- published computer science, to provide its data convergence characteristics, and
- data standards like [JSON](http://json.org/), [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/)
  and [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/), to provide interoperability and
  future-proofing.

The specification and implementation of **m-ld**'s core will be published as
soon as possible online, in computer science literature, and as free and
open-source software.
