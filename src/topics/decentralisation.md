In principle, **m-ld** clones are low-cost replicates and can be created and
destroyed with impunity. They are
["cattle,&nbsp;not&nbsp;pets"](http://cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/the-history-of-pets-vs-cattle/).
This is unlike the traditional database approach of carefully looking after
individual database instances.

*Decentralisation* in **m-ld** is technically enabled by the low cost of clone
replication. The natural deployment pattern is to keep the clone engine close to
the app, usually in-process, and so there is no need for a central database. In
many deployments it may be desireable to have some clones on servers, to ensure
data safety â€“ but these are more like backups.

### Resilience
A domain with sufficient clones is *resilient* to infrastructure failures. In
this respect and others, clones are similar to microservices.

The permanent loss of an individual clone is typically inconsequential to the
data safety of the domain. Updates are published and received by clones on a
continuous basis, interruptible only by network unavailability.

### Authority
In the absence of necessary centralisation, an app is at liberty (and has a
responsibility) to decide an authority model that works best for the domain.
**m-ld** is generally agnostic to who owns data and decides data correctness.
However, it does collaborate with the app to secure the data against
[unauthorised&nbsp;access](/doc/#security).

### Realisation
Decentralisation is realised by a foundational protocol for data sharing which
is:
- convergent: all clones will eventually have the same data.
- automatic: the app never needs to request or react to synchronisation with the
  domain (it does need to react to individual data changes, but this is
  irrespective of where they arise).
- efficient: a new clone or a re-starting clone is able to quickly rev-up to
  equivalence with other live clones. Furthermore, it can accept updates
  *before* this process completes.

More detail on data sharing is found in the [concurrency](/doc/#concurrency)
section.
