We've had a busy Christmas here at **m-ld.io**, working towards a Beta of the
core specification and the Javascript engine.

The biggest ticket on our list was Lists! So we're happy to announce that we've
worked out the [specification](https://spec.m-ld.org/#lists) and completed a
prototype implementation.

We've also put together an article all about multi-collaborator editable lists;
we'll post the link just as soon as it's published.

We're looking forward to 2021. Let us know what you're building!
