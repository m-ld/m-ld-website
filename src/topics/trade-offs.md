While adhering to the principles above and the **m-ld**
[specification](https://spec.m-ld.org/), engines may offer differing quality of
service, balancing non-functional considerations. These might also be affected
by configuration options.

In all cases, [engine](/doc/#platforms) documentation will provide the necessary details.

### Query Patterns
An engine may support a subset of the API query syntax, perhaps because of
limitations of the platform storage, but also driven by optimisation for the
queries of typical apps on that platform.

### Threading
All operations on **m-ld** data are inherently asychronous and therefore assumed
to be [concurrent](/doc/#concurrency) with other operations. Each engine maps
this model onto the threading model of the platform, balancing the soonest
return of control to the app against the complexity of handling out-of-band
errors.

### Performance
Engines may balance performance of some operations against others, as well as
against other considerations. For example, a clone whose storage is entirely
in-memory will offer the fastest transaction performance, but must re-cache all
of its data from the domain on start-up. Or there could be an option to
periodically flush the memory data to disk â€“ and so on.

### Scalability
Every clone logically provides access to all the data in the domain. In most
engine implementations, this means that all the data must be stored locally
â€“ as this will also provide the fastest access and best data safety.
