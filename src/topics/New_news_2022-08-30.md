There’s been a bit of a gap since the last m-ld news update, but that changes as of today!  First up:
## The m-ld team expands
In case you didn’t already know, [Angus McAllister](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angus-mcallister/) has now joined m-ld full-time as Head of Product and Community, after 6 years at Amazon Web Services (and a number of other multinationals before then).  This was actually all the way back in April this year, and we meant to announce it then, but we’ve been super-busy on other stuff, lots of which we *can* tell you about, and some of which you’ll have to wait a bit longer to read.  My focus is on working with customers (developers, software architects, technical product managers, etc.) to define and refine our products so they meet their needs optimally.  And to do that, I’ve begun building a vibrant community around them.  Hopefully that’s what’s brought you here today to read this!
## Workshop - The Power of Live Linked Data to Transform
One of the first things I did upon arrival was to organise an in-person workshop with this title.  13 of us from a broad range of organisations got together in Utrecht, Netherlands in May 2022 to talk through a most interesting set of topics relating to Live Data and Linked Data, and how combining these gives rise to some powerful solutions to long-standing technology challenges, especially in the area of creating decentralised software.  We recorded the sessions - check them out on our YouTube channel:

## Federating Sovereign Systems using Live Linked Data
On that theme, [NLnet Assure](https://nlnet.nl) awarded a further grant to a consortium of 4 organisations (ourselves, [Ponder Source](https://pondersource.com/), [Evoludata](https://www.evoludata.com/), and [Muze](https://www.muze.nl/) to build a federation of Time-Tracking systems as a precursor to the more general case of federating Bookkeeping systems.  We have been collaborating closely with them, and are very close to completing this successfully.  The project has highlighted nuanced differences between data federation and integration, the management of both identities and identifiers, and a host of other things.  There’s a great deal more to explore to build on this, which we hope to do in a follow-on project.  Ultimately, we’re working towards making it possible for all information to be live, irrespective of the application being used to work with it, and this is an important step along that journey.  You can find out more about the project [here](https://github.com/federatedbookkeeping/timesheets).
## Securing Shared Decentralised Live Information
You might  recognise this from an earlier news update.  “What’s become of this?”, you might be wondering.  Well, the truth is that we spotted the chance to build an exemplar app for this in the Federated Timesheets project, and have woven the two projects together.  More details to come!
## Other stuff
We can’t say much more about this just yet, but there are some exciting developments bubbling up of a more commercial nature, and as soon as we can go public on these, we will.  Hold tight in the meantime.
